### **Overview**
The Sustainable Sentosa Framework was established to serve as one of SDC’s key strategic thrusts. The framework promotes sustainability across SDC and its subsidiaries’ operations, in line with national sustainability initiatives to mitigate climate-related risks. The Sustainable Sentosa Framework sits alongside other strategic imperatives, including SDC’s commitment to guest satisfaction and ensuring their wellbeing and safety, while creating a vibrant island economy and a nurturing and safe working environment for all staff.
