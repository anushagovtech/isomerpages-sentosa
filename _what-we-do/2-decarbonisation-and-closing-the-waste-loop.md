### **Decarbonisation and Closing the Waste Loop**
		
In line with Singapore’s goal to reduce its emissions intensity and SDC’s aim of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 for Sentosa island, SDC is working towards reducing its energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions. This ensures that Sentosa continues to develop as a sustainable leisure destination. SDC will support our Island Partners on decarbonisation initiatives, track Sentosa’s carbon emissions, trial new solutions, as well as work together with guests, the island community and technology partners to meet its collective climate goals.

To understand the overall carbon profile of Sentosa and what decarbonisation measures and solutions can be most efficiently deployed, SDC has been part of a study with Temasek since June 2021. Beyond decarbonisation  measures and solutions, SDC will also support the island’s businesses on sourcing of credible and quality carbon offsets. 

While SDC’s share of Sentosa’s overall carbon footprint is estimated to be only between 6% to 8%, SDC is in a privileged position where it can influence the island’s carbon profile as its master planner, landlord, precinct operator, brand ambassador and custodian of Sentosa. 

The Sentosa Carbon Neutral Network, which is Singapore’s first carbon neutrality-focused business alliance and was formed and estimated to cover more than 90% of the island’s carbon profile. Under the network, members will discuss emerging trends, explore opportunities to build capabilities, share resources and leverage economies of scale towards outcomes that mitigate climate impacts on Sentosa. SCNN members are collectively committed towards the carbon neutrality by 2030 goal through carbon reduction efforts. As a consortium of on-island businesses spanning hotels and F&B, the SCNN will be able to develop Sentosa-wide sustainability solutions through the sharing of resources and expertise, while also leveraging economies of scale and a common network to introduce large-scale solutions, such as the aggregation of demand for locally sourced produce across Sentosa’s hotels and restaurants. SCNN will also invest in credible carbon offsets and imported renewable energy to neutralise the remaining carbon profile.

#### **Waste Management**
To encourage guests to recycle and empower guests to adopt an eco-conscious lifestyle, SDC has collaborated with the National Environment Agency (NEA) to roll out smart Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs) which reward guests for recycling their drink containers (aluminium cans or plastic bottles). To reward guests who recycle their drink containers, they will be able to redeem a Free Sentosa Fun Pass (5 tokens) for every 10 drink containers recycled. The main goal of test-bedding the RVMs at Sentosa is to encourage guests to do their part for the environment and cultivate a habit a recycling. For FY2020/2021, SDC is glad to share that a total of 17,538 drink containers were recycled, with guests redeeming a total of 1621 Sentosa Fun Passes.

Since July 2021, SGC is also currently test-bedding an on-site food waste digestor, which results in either non-portable water or compost being generated as the end-product to reduce food waste generated.

Disposables make up a significant amount of SDC’s total waste. As such, SDC recognises the importance of implementing new initiatives within the Group to play a part in minimising the number of disposables used. For example, at SDC’s Human Resource department, disposable water bottles are not provided during internal staff events or meetings conducted. 
In addition to reducing disposables internally, it is also important to encourage guests to reduce waste and adopt a more environmentally conscious lifestyle. To reduce the amount of waste generated at Sentosa, SDC has pledged to reduce food wastage and the use of disposables by supporting the National Environment Agency (NEA)’s “Say Yes to Waste Less” Campaign. Through this campaign, SDC aims to create a more sustainable future by encouraging all Island Partners to adopt and implement the campaign on their premises, as well as at the Group’s own operations to encourage guests to cultivate a habit of reducing food wastage and using lesser disposables. For example, at SGC’s food and beverages establishments, disposables such as one-time use utensils and plastic bottles are not provided to all guests. Water stations are accessible for all to use instead.
