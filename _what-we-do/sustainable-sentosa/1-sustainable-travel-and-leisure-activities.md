**1 - Sustainable Travel and Leisure Activities**
	<p>
		
With 40 hectares of protected nature areas, more than 20 heritage trees, over 100 recorded bird species, and a variety of walking and cycling trails on the island, Sentosa is a haven for nature lovers. 

To bring guests closer to the island’s hidden gems, a slew of immersive nature activities was launched over the years, including the Siloso Headland Intertidal Programme and nature bathing tours.

In 2020 Sentosa also launched Singapore's first carbon neutral beers. The Sentosa Islander Brew is a series of four beers made in collaboration with Brewerkz, a local craft brewery. Each beer is inspired by a unique Sentosa experience – Island Life, Nature Adventure, Heritage Discovery, and Wellness Escape – so guests can #MakeTime for a holiday anywhere. 
		
By 2022 guests can look forward to the launch of sustainability-themed tours that aim to increase the appreciation and protection of nature, biodiversity, and heritage on Sentosa. The Southern Islands experiences will also be launched with Sentosa as a conduit to the archipelago. Guests can engage in more leisure experiences with a low carbon footprint, enabled through unique and sustainable off-grid offerings powered by 100% renewable energy. 

Sentosa island is not just a resort destination but a living classroom too. Home to historical sites, nature trails and wildlife, we hope to partner with educators to leverage on Sentosa's uniqueness and add a twist to existing structured curriculum!
