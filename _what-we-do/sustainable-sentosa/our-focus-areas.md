### **Our Focus Areas**
The Sustainable Sentosa framework promotes sustainability across the Group’s operations, in line with the national sustainability initiatives to mitigate climate-related risks. There are three main focus areas : Sustainable Travel and Leisure Activities, Decarbonisation and Closing the Waste Loop, and Integrative Planning, Design and Development of Masterplan Zones.

With 40 hectares of protected nature areas, more than 20 heritage trees, over 100 recorded bird species, and a variety of walking and cycling trails on the island, Sentosa is a haven for nature lovers. 

To bring guests closer to the island’s hidden gems, a slew of immersive nature activities was launched over the years, including the Siloso Headland Intertidal Programme and nature bathing tours.
