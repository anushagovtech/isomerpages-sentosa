### **Sentosa Climate Change Risk Assessment**
Sentosa, a 500-hectares resort island located at the southern tip of Singapore, has a range of attractions, from nature trails, to beaches, destination dining, theme parks and spa resorts. In 2019, Sentosa hosts more than 19 million tourists, making Sentosa Asia’s leading tourist destination. Additionally, Sentosa Cove, a residential enclave located in Sentosa, is home to more than 6000 residents across 2000 households.

From an ecological perspective, 8 different habitats can be found on the island, including coastal forest, secondary forest, rocky seashores, intertidal and more. 26 heritage trees had been identified together with a thriving biohabitat from ridge to reef, resident to corals, tropical marine-life, insect-eating plants, butterflies, and hundreds of migratory birds. This is under threat from climate change. 

According to the 2014 IPCC report , global temperatures are expected to rise by 1.7°C to 4.8°C by 2100. Thus, a faster rate of melting of the Arctic ice sheets and an increase in thermal expansion of water due to warmer temperatures is expected to cause sea levels to rise by more than a meter. Both the rise in surface temperatures and sea level are major threats to the Sentosa Island and its functions:
