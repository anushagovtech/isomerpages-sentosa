    <th>Project Description</th>
    <td>An Environmental Study was commissioned by the Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) in July 2020 under the Contract No. SDC/21.8.2/19 - Provision of Multi-Disciplinary Consultancy Services For The Proposed Deep Gravity Sewers Project at Sentosa (hereinafter referred to as “the Project”) to assess the potential environmental impacts (i.e. biodiversity, airborne noise, air quality, surface water quality) arising from the construction phase of the Project towards human and ecologically sensitive receptors in the vicinity of the worksites.

This Project would involve the implementation of a pure gravitational Deep Gravity Sewers (hereinafter referred to as “DGS”) system on Sentosa to replace the existing aging sewer network comprising of gravitational surface sewer networks and pumping stations and networks. The existing sewer network across Sentosa was constructed about 30 to 40 years ago and had been showing signs of dilapidation with breakdowns and chokage, posing constant odour and contamination risks.

The DGS system would be more efficient, reliable and sustainable as a long term solution to serve Sentosa for the next 100 years. This is also aligned with the Public Utilities Board (PUB)’s similar approach on mainland Singapore with the implementation of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS).
The construction of the DGS system would consist approximately 3.9 km of 1200 mm diameter pipes, 2.0 km of 1500 mm diameter pipes and 148 m of 2000 mm diameter pipes with a total of forty (40) proposed manholes, as well as other ancillary sewer connections and small ancillary manholes of diameter ranging from 300 mm to 600 mm. Overall, the DGS system will convey wastewater discharge collected from all the existing surface sewers on Sentosa and discharge into the DTSS via a proposed link sewer manhole located near the Sentosa Gateway Gantry.

The works associated with the Project would mainly consist of pre-construction activities (e.g. temporary traffic and drainage works, site clearance, establishment of temporary worksites) and main construction activities (e.g. temporary shaft construction, pipejacking works, manhole construction, general landscaping and finishing works). According to the current planning schedule, the actual pre-construction activities would begin with site clearances and preparations in 2023 with the overall construction targeted to be completed in 2027.
