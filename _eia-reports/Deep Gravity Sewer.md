    <th>Project Description</th>
    <td>An Environmental Study was commissioned by the Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) in July 2020 under the Contract No. SDC/21.8.2/19 - Provision of Multi-Disciplinary Consultancy Services For The Proposed Deep Gravity Sewers Project at Sentosa (hereinafter referred to as “the Project”) to assess the potential environmental impacts (i.e. biodiversity, airborne noise, air quality, surface water quality) arising from the construction phase of the Project towards human and ecologically sensitive receptors in the vicinity of the worksites.

This Project would involve the implementation of a pure gravitational Deep Gravity Sewers (hereinafter referred to as “DGS”) system on Sentosa to replace the existing aging sewer network comprising of gravitational surface sewer networks and pumping stations and networks. The existing sewer network across Sentosa was constructed about 30 to 40 years ago and had been showing signs of dilapidation with breakdowns and chokage, posing constant odour and contamination risks.

The DGS system would be more efficient, reliable and sustainable as a long term solution to serve Sentosa for the next 100 years. This is also aligned with the Public Utilities Board (PUB)’s similar approach on mainland Singapore with the implementation of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS).
The construction of the DGS system would consist approximately 3.9 km of 1200 mm diameter pipes, 2.0 km of 1500 mm diameter pipes and 148 m of 2000 mm diameter pipes with a total of forty (40) proposed manholes, as well as other ancillary sewer connections and small ancillary manholes of diameter ranging from 300 mm to 600 mm. Overall, the DGS system will convey wastewater discharge collected from all the existing surface sewers on Sentosa and discharge into the DTSS via a proposed link sewer manhole located near the Sentosa Gateway Gantry.

The works associated with the Project would mainly consist of pre-construction activities (e.g. temporary traffic and drainage works, site clearance, establishment of temporary worksites) and main construction activities (e.g. temporary shaft construction, pipejacking works, manhole construction, general landscaping and finishing works). According to the current planning schedule, the actual pre-construction activities would begin with site clearances and preparations in 2023 with the overall construction targeted to be completed in 2027.

    <th>Environmental Study Summary</th>
    <td>Following preliminary assessment of the entire route of the project alignment, it was discussed with technical agencies that the key focus of the Environmental Study would be of project worksites near the identified Nature Areas (i.e. Mt Imbiah and Mt Serapong). Additionally, the Environmental Study would assess impacts arising from the above-ground construction of the manhole/ shaft on the environment (i.e. biodiversity, airborne noise, air quality, surface water quality). It was assessed that the DGS system would unlikely result in environmental impacts during its operation.

The Environmental Study was conducted based on the preliminary design provided in July 2020. AAny major changes in the engineering design in the future and/or changes in the baseline environment would require the re-evaluation of the findings of this Environmental Study and consultation with the relevant technical agencies and authorities.

According to the current planning, the Project would require forty (40) above-ground construction worksites that range from approximately 300 m2 to 700 m2 to support the construction of the forty (40) proposed DGS manholes and the associated pipelines. All works will be carried out in group of manholes (about 5 to 6 worksites working concurrently in group) and by phases, with each construction worksite approximately requiring an average of 12 months to complete the construction works.

Based on the impacts on the environmental parameters during the impact prediction and evaluation process, minimum controls or best practices on site were considered to mitigate/alleviate any significant environmental construction impacts (“Moderate” or “Major” impacts). Where the implementation of minimum controls were insufficient, project-specific final mitigation measures (in consultation with SDC) were proposed to reduce the environmental impacts to “Minor”, “Negligible” or as low as reasonably practicable as part of the residual impact assessment. 

The summary of impact significance (with minimum controls) and the potential residual impact significance (after considering mitigation measures for moderate and major impact significance) of the assessed environmental aspects for construction phase of the Project are presented in the following table. All impacts were found to be insignificant after the implementation of minimum control measures and the recommended mitigation measures, except for Biodiversity. <img src="/images/eia/Capture.jpg"/> During the course of the Environmental Study, the biodiversity specialist identified the presence of bamboo bats (Tylonycteris sp.) living within the bamboo clusters at the Mt. Imbiah and Mt. Serapong study areas, in proximity to the proposed worksites (e.g. MH31). To avoid direct significant impacts, the environmental engineers worked closely with the design engineers and the biodiversity specialist to optimise the worksite design, reduce the construction footprint and avoid the felling of the bamboo cluster. Furthermore, to reduce indirect impacts, it was proposed that suitable sound barriers be placed around the worksite and for the bamboo cluster to be demarcated with a Tree Protection Zone of 6 m radius from the centre of the cluster.

While measures were proposed to reduce the impact on overall biodiversity, the residual impact significance remained “Moderate” mainly due to the bamboo bats (Tylonycteris sp.). Given the paucity in information on the sensitivity and response of the bamboo bats (Tylonycteris sp.) to disturbances in their surrounding environment; to err on the side of caution, it was assessed that they might still be affected even after the implementation of mitigation measures.

A construction phase EMMP was proposed to (1) ensure that any potential impacts arising from the project were within anticipated levels and (2) assess the effectiveness of the recommended minimum control measures and site mitigation measures in reducing identified environmental related impacts on key receptors. The EMMP would progressively scrutinise construction activities as they ensue and ensure suitable monitoring and management procedures would be in place to address unforeseen impacts that may arise.</td>
